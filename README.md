# PhysicClaw-VEA
PHYSIC-CLAW-VEA is a real-time, interactive visualization environment designed to give a digital "body" to the Soul of an OpenClaw agent. The project transcends the conventional chat interface, transforming the agent's activity logs, karma, and identity into a dynamic 3D entity that resides on the web.
